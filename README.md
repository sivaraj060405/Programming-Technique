# Reflection
Programming Technique 1 has been one of the most challenging courses I have undertaken so far, and most of the concepts are learned through practical, hands-on learning rather than theoretically. The revision materials were comprehensive, but online resources were what I used the most to solve the problems I found tricky. The final assignment, as such, made me realize how a project is a complex thing, with things like input/ output functions and arrays fitted together. This experience showed me the importance of further improving my coding skills to remain competitive in the IT field. Incorporating more discussions on strategies for tackling large-scale projects would enhance our understanding of essential techniques and better prepare us for complex coding tasks.
